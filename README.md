# Learning Go

This is a Go project for learning the basics of the Go programming language. The project contains several packages, including the `pointer` package, which contains two files:

- `pointerCase1.go`: A program that demonstrates how to use pointers in Go.
- `pointerCase2.go`: A program that demonstrates how to use pointer receivers in Go.

## Pointer Package

The `pointer` package contains programs that demonstrate the use of pointers in Go. The following files are included:

- `pointerCase1.go`: A program that demonstrates how to use pointers to store memory addresses.
- `pointerCase2.go`: A program that demonstrates how to use pointer receivers to modify values.

Each file contains detailed comments that explain the purpose of the program and how it works.

To run these programs, navigate to the `pointer` directory and run `go run pointerCase1.go` or `go run pointerCase2.go` in the terminal.
